A simple IRC client written in Python. It runs in a terminal and uses the curses library as a display.

It carries most features you would expect of any client, and it also provides low-level access to receive and send raw data to the server.

Features of note:
Channels and queries are all given their own screens. The currently displaying one can be changed with TAB.
Scrolling through a window is done with the arrow keys.
