Critical issues
=================================


Normal things
=================================
Implement the rest of the common user commands:
/kick op-only
/mode op-only
/topic op-only
Different input buffers for every channel


Minor things
=================================
Implement bolding of text with ^B characters/underlining with ^_ characters
Bold messages that appear when current nick is mentioned
If new activity happens in other windows raising a !, tab should go over to them without cycling through other channels


Wishlist
=================================
Add a user-specific ~/.irc_conf file that maps server/nick combinations to realname/ident combos. When a user tries to log into a server/nick combo that exists, autosupply the ident and real name (override if they are specified on the command line). This file can also be used for other defaults.
Make the time limit settable as a conf file setting.
Add a locking option/lurker mode that ignores all your input unless it is the unlocking command
Add a command to display a list of windows.
