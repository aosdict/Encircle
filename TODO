Add a user-specific ~/.irc_conf file that maps server/nick combinations to realname/ident combos. When a user tries to log into a server/nick combo that exists, autosupply the ident and real name (override if they are specified on the command line). This file can also be used for other defaults.
Make the time limit settable as a conf file setting.
Add a locking option/lurker mode that ignores all your input unless it is the unlocking command
Implement the rest of the common user commands.
Implement bolding of text with ^B characters/underlining with ^_ characters
Bold messages that appear when current nick is mentioned

User commands that are not represented in the code:
/kick op-only
/mode op-only
/topic op-only

Server messages unrepresented:
307 mynick theirnick :is a registered nick
900 mynick mynick!ident@server mynick :you are now logged in
